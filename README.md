# Technical assignment front-end engineer

Make an application that allows the user to view the observed (in the past 30 days) or forecasted (in the future) daily weather conditions for a given location using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs).

You are free to use the tools and frameworks you prefer unless stated otherwise.

**Requirements**

The three pillars of front-end development are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like to see you know how to use them for the right job.

* Use ReactJS
* Pay attention to semantics: any HTML might work, but choosing the right tags show you care
* Show us you know how to create a modern user interface using CSS or your favourite CSS preprocessor
* Communicate to the Dark Sky API through a PHP back-end



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
